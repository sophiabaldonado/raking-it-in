# Raking It In

_This game was made by [sophia](https://twitter.com/yokopuffs) and [jocelyn](https://twitter.com/jocelyngee) for the 2018 Seattle Indies Game Jam._

You’re just an ordinary kid lookin' to buy yourself a new super awesome bike. It's $500, so what do you do? You do your chores and you sell lemonade and you go to your neighbors' houses to do some yard work and raise money.

Today you're going to Mrs. Old Lady Cranshaw’s house because she can't do her own yard work -- she's too old and wrinkly. She says she’ll give you $20 if you rake the leaves in her back yard.

Sounds easy enough, but you never know what you’ll find in an old lady’s back yard.

## Tips:
- You drop your pocket money when you die so deposit to your piggy bank often by pressing the down arrow when standing near it
- Buy extra lives from the shop when needed by pressing the right arrow when standing near it
- Keep your eye on the prize!
